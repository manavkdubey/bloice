# README: Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Conversion with OpenAI

This repository contains Python code that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 and Whisper models to perform Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) conversions. The code records audio, transcribes it using OpenAI's Whisper STT model, generates a response using GPT-3, and converts the response text into speech using OpenAI's TTS model. This README provides an overview of the code and its usage.

## Prerequisites
Before using this code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenAI Python SDK (`openai`)
3. PyAudio (`pyaudio`)
4. Wave (`wave`)
5. PyDub (`pydub`)
6. Dotenv (`dotenv`)
7. Pygame (`pygame`)

You should also have an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain by signing up for an account on the OpenAI platform.

## Usage

### 1. Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages listed above using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your OpenAI API key:

```
PROJECT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 2. Recording and Transcription
- The code records audio for a specified duration (5 seconds by default) using the PyAudio library.
- The recorded audio is then saved as an MP3 file named `input.mp3`.
- The `openai` library is used to transcribe the audio using the Whisper STT model.
- The transcribed text is stored in the `transcript` variable.

### 3. Chat Completion
- The transcribed text is used as a prompt for the GPT-3 model to generate a response.
- The code sends a system message and user message to the GPT-3 model.
- The response generated by GPT-3 is extracted and printed to the console.

### 4. Text-to-Speech Conversion
- The generated response from GPT-3 is passed to the OpenAI TTS model for conversion.
- The TTS model generates an MP3 file named `blah.mp3` containing the synthesized speech.

### 5. Playback
- The Pygame library is used to play the synthesized speech.
- The code loads the `blah.mp3` file and plays it through the speakers.

### 6. Cleanup
- The generated audio files (`input.mp3` and `blah.mp3`) are created in the project directory and can be used as needed.

## Important Notes
- Make sure your microphone is properly configured and connected to your computer to record audio.
- You can customize the recording parameters such as duration and audio format in the code.
